accordance with the purpose of the association and follow the bylaws of
the association.

Membership in MA is also open to companies, institutes, universities and
other organizations, which agree to support the purpose of the
association and follow the bylaws of the association.

An organizational member has to appoint an individual person affiliated
to the organization to represent the organization in all matters related
to the MA. This person is the organization's liaison member. The
benefits granted to organizational and individual members are decided by
the Assembly. The voting rules are further specified in these Bylaws.

    assembly as board members.   

The number of additional Board members and their duties for the upcoming
election period are defined at the latest in the Assembly meeting before
the Assembly meeting where the election takes place.

Alternate Board members can be present at every Board meeting, and perform voting 
rights in case the non-alternate board member they represent is absent.

the absence of the Chairperson the Vice-Chairperson will take over. The
Assembly has the right to approve individuals to be present and have the
right to speak at the meeting.

person delegated by the Assembly. The minutes will be signed by the
Chairperson of the meeting and at least one other member of the Assembly

of individual members is noted. Any members who arrive/depart during the
meeting will be noted on arrival/departure.

## § 6 Signing authority ##

The Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson and the Treasurer each individually
have signing authority for the firm of MA.

The Assembly can authorize a private person, with the limitations
determined by the Assembly, to be a signatory for the firm of MA. This
authority may be revoked at any time by the Assembly.

A decision on dissolution may only be made after the matter has been
approved by The Board.

The remaining funds will be donated to other non-profit organizations with similar goals as MA.

## § 12 Assembly meetings of the Modelica Association ##

The MA Board determines dates for Assembly meetings during the year.
The Assembly meetings are to be held digitally.
When necessary, the Board can schedule additional Assembly meetings. At

including date, location and preliminary agenda to MA members in writing

## § 14 Voting ##

An individual member present at an Assembly meeting, has the right to vote. 

An organizational member may exercise voting rights through one
appointed representative present at an Assembly meeting. This is either
(a) the liaison member of the organizational member or (b) a person
acting for the organization that has been given mandate for an Assembly
meeting or an *electronic voting*, by informing the MA Board in writing at
least one week prior to the start of the meeting or the *electronic
voting*. Each such representative has one vote. An individual member who
accepts to be a representative of an organization at a meeting can 
exercise both his/her voting rights as an individual member and the voting right 
for the organization he/she represents during that meeting.

A member must be present at a meeting to execute his/her voting rights
(see §5 for the definition of "present"), except for *electronic voting*
(see the definition of *electronic voting* at the end of this paragraph).

The Assembly constitutes a quorum when at least nine members are present
which have the right to vote, one of whom is the Chairperson or
Vice-Chairperson. For an *electronic voting*, at least nine valid votes
have to be submitted, one of these votes must be from the Chairperson or
Vice-Chairperson.

A *normal decision* is made by *simple majority*. Here a proposal must
receive more than 50 per cent of the valid votes submitted.

A *qualified decision* is made by a *qualified majority.* Here a
proposal must receive at least two thirds of the valid votes submitted.

A vote abstention is not a submitted vote.

Unless otherwise noted, the *normal decision* has to be applied.

In the event of more than two alternatives, and none of the alternatives
gets the necessary majority, the two alternatives with most votes are
contested in a final vote.

If a member so desires, election of persons will take place by secret
ballot.

An *electronic voting* has to be announced at least 2 weeks before the
voting takes place, and the final proposal (e.g. consisting of a
specification, or a library) must be generally available at least 1 week
before the vote. The voting period is 6 working days. Every member of MA
can vote. The same voting rules as for an Assembly meeting apply. Every
member must have the possibility to inspect the submitted votes. A vote
counter elected at the Assembly meeting summarizes the result and sends
it to all members of MA. For secret ballots, an appropriate anonymous service
has to be used in this case. The service and method to be used for the
anonymous voting must be announced together with the agenda of the meeting.

## § 15 Accountants ##

The appointment of accountants takes places every fourth annual Assembly
meeting. If a position of the accountants becomes vacant, this
accountant member must be appointed at the next Assembly meeting for the
duration until the next scheduled MA accountant appointment.

# The Board #

## § 16 Constitution of the Board ##

A Board member must be a member of MA (personal or part of an organizational member).

The election of the MA Board takes place at every second annual Assembly
meeting, for a duration of two years. If a position of the Board becomes vacant or one more Board
member shall be introduced, this Board member can be elected at the next
Assembly meeting for the duration until the next scheduled MA Board
election.

# Other regulations #

## § 18 Expulsion ##

A member may not be expelled from MA for any other reason than that he
or she has failed to pay the fees determined by MA, worked against the
interests of MA operations, violates laws or regulations that MA has to
fulfill, or clearly damaged the reputation or interests of MA or its
members.

Expulsion is decided on Assembly meetings and applies immediately. The
issue of expulsion may not be decided on until the member has been given
the opportunity to state his or her case in writing and the item has
been discussed by the Assembly.

MA will not refund rightfully paid annual fees.

## § 19 Authors of common documents from MA ##

Individuals who have contributed to common documents from MA or from MA
projects are specified collectively as authors of these documents if
they so wish. In case of conflicting opinions, the Assembly decides on
the authors of MA documents or MA project documents, provided there are
no specific project rules for MA project documents that resolve such a
conflict.

## § 20 Register of members ##

The MA maintains a member list. All organizational members are published on the MA website, individual members optionally.

# Modelica Association Projects #

## § 21 Registration of Modelica Association Projects ##

Long term development activities in the scope of the Modelica
Association (see § 2) can be organized in Modelica Association Projects
(MAP). The organizational structure and the rules of each MAP can be
determined independently by this project, as long as they are compliant
with the MA Bylaws, especially with the rules defined in § 22 and § 23.
A set of MAP rules is recommended in the provided 
[MA-Project-Template](MA-Project-Template.md) (this template is not
part of the MA Bylaws).

After a candidate for a project has been proposed to the MA, the MA
Assembly decides on the registration of a project as a MAP with a
qualified majority (see § 14). Registered MAPs are listed on MA's
homepage (currently <http://www.modelica.org>) with their registration
data and a link to the MAP web page.

## § 22 Procedure for registration and de-registration of Modelica Association Projects ##

The proposal of a project for registration as MAP must contain

  - Name and purpose of the project.

  - Rules under which the project intends to work.

  - Initial members of the project (individual and organizational). A
    MAP must have a reasonable number of members.

  - Name, organization and position of the project leader (and deputy) fulfilling 
the requirements of §23.

## § 23 Terms and conditions for Modelica Association Projects ##

Every MA Project Leader and Deputy Project Leader needs to fulfil the requirements for 
an MA board member.

The MAP leader has to prepare a report about the project operation of
the previous year for the MA Annual Assembly meeting.

MA projects can change their rules (which have been previously accepted
by MA) only, if accepted by the MA Board.

MAPs are encouraged to apply for approval of their results by MA as MA
standard according to § 2.

MAPs must make the results of the project work publicly available on the
web under an open source license (usually an open source license approved
by the Open Source Initiative, see http://www.opensource.org/licenses).

Beyond that, MAPs are responsible for their financial and human
resources. MA has the right to support certain works of a MAP with MA
funding with a qualified majority of the Assembly (see § 14).

A MAP member can become a MA member according to § 3, but does not have to.

MA has the right to revoke the registration of a MAP if (a) MA bylaws
are violated, (b) laws or regulations that MA has to follow are
violated, or (c) the MAP is changed so that it is no longer compliant
with MA.

If the MA Board suspects that one of the situations from the previous
paragraph occured it can within 2 months request the MA Project in
writing (including email) to remedy the situation. If the project does
not remove the cause within 2 months after the request of the MA Board,
then the project can be revoked from the MA. For this exclusion a
qualified majority of a MA Assembly (see § 14) is necessary.

Resignation of a project as a MAP applies immediately after MA received
the written notice.
